### 🚀 Why Choose Kitan

Traditional verification methods like captchas, security questions, and puzzles can be circumvented with human
assistance. Moreover, not all advertisement senders are bots; real users may also send ads.

Hence, we need a verification method tailored to the current environment, ensuring that users are within the platform
and have undergone self-defense testing.

Kitan achieves this by using quick fingerprint verification and puzzle proof-of-work within the authentication mechanism
to ensure users are real humans.

Additionally, Kitan employs risk control techniques, combining LLM/NLP/big data technologies for AI behavior analysis,
monitoring user behavior from joining to leaving groups, effectively preventing personal attacks and real human
advertisement harassment.
